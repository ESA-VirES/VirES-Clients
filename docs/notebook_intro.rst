Introduction to notebooks
=========================

Jupyter notebooks are a convenient tool for interactive data exploration and are used here to demonstrate usage of ``viresclient``. We encourage users to try out Jupyter for themselves and to consider sharing notebooks with others.

Here is a list of related notebook repositories where you are welcome to submit changes or additions. Please get in touch if you would like your own repository to be listed here.
