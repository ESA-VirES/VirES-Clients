Introduction to notebooks
=========================

Jupyter notebooks are a convenient tool for interactive data exploration and are used here to demonstrate usage of ``viresclient``. We encourage users to try out Jupyter for themselves and to consider sharing notebooks with others. If you have a comment about one of the notebooks, or would like a particular demonstration, you can `open a GitHub Issue <https://github.com/smithara/viresclient_examples/issues/new>`_ or get in touch otherwise.

Click `here <https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/smithara/viresclient_examples/>`_ (nbviewer) to view viresclient_examples non-interactively. Sometimes notebooks won't render directly on the GitHub website - try `nbviewer <https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/>`_ instead.

Here is a list of related notebook repositories where you are welcome to submit changes or additions. Please get in touch if you would like your own repository to be listed here.
